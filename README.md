# A Practical Comparison of Mastodon and Micro.blog

Many of us are [looking at Twitter alternatives](https://birchtree.me/blog/the-struggle-for-twitter-alternatives/) and there are two services that stand out: **Micro.blog** and **Mastodon**.

These services take different approaches, so choosing one is challenging.
This page highlights some of the differences and is meant for non-nerds who don't want to get bogged down by implementation details.
Every attempt has been made to be accurate, but some technical details are deliberately glossed over.

> For more about similar services, see the [Comparison of microblogging services on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_microblogging_services)
